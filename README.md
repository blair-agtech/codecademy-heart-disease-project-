## 🎯 Project Overview

This project examines whether patients diagnosed with heart disease exhibit significantly elevated cholesterol levels and fasting blood sugar compared to clinical thresholds and population baselines.

### Key Research Questions
1. Do patients with heart disease have mean cholesterol levels significantly higher than 240 mg/dl?
2. Is the prevalence of elevated fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl) in this clinical sample significantly higher than the 1988 U.S. national average of 8%?
3. How do cardiovascular metrics differ between patients with and without heart disease?
